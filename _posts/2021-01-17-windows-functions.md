Windows functions are effective ways of applying functions to row partitions (windows). Using our sample registered voter [dataset](https://github.com/ShanNatRichards/postgreSQL/blob/main/voters_table.sql), let's use windows functions to describe voter distribution (by streets) in a district.

See full code at the end.

There are 1240 voters in this particularly voting district with 73 district streets.


1. Let's first create a CTE that provides a count of the number of voters per distinct street, which will use in our windows functions

```SQL

WITH stg AS 
(
    SELECT  w.street,
            COUNT(*) AS num_of_voters
    FROM wbw_voters  w
    GROUP BY w.street
),

```

2. Use window function RANK() to rank streets by the number of registered voters per street.
   The ORDER BY clause specifies that ranking should done in descending order on the number of voters and then by the name of street (in case of ties).
   

```SQL

RANK() OVER (ORDER BY s.num_of_voters DESC, s.street) AS rank

```

3. With POSTGRES we can use the aggregrate function SUM as a windows function to get a running sum of voters.
    The ORDER BY clause indicates the order should be in descending order on the number of voters and then by the name of street (in case of ties).

```SQL

SUM(s.num_of_voters) OVER (ORDER BY s.num_of_voters DESC, s.street) AS running_sum_voters    

```
4. We can also get the running total percentage of voters with another SUM windows function

```SQL
SUM(a.pct_voters) OVER (ORDER BY a.pct_voters DESC, a.street) AS running_pct
```


5. Results

Of the 73 streets in our voting district, 50.55% of registered voters in the district live on only 14 of those streets. 

If we look a little closely, we see that majority of those thoroughfares in the top 14 are roads. We could surmise that roads have more housing units than lanes (LN) or closes (CL).

           s.street,
           s.num_of_voters,
           SUM(s.num_of_voters) OVER (ORDER BY s.num_of_voters DESC, s.street) AS running_sum_voters,       
           ROUND ((((s.num_of_voters) / sum(s.num_of_voters) OVER ()) * (100)), 2) AS pct_voters
